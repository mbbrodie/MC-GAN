https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.09846.pdf : Population Based Training of Neural Networks
- Deepmind paper
- mentions sequential and parallel training, random and grid search.
    - sequential usually gets best results, but consumes the most time
- COMPARE their results to yours. (PBT -> consider doing PBT-MC-GAN)
